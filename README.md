# Software Development using Anemic/Rich Domain Classes
Example of software development using anemic domain classes and by using rich domain classes. This project is a simple example of how building software might look from two different approaches for modelling the domain classes:
* Rich Domain classes - with both state and behavior
* Anemic Domain classe - no state or behavior (bags of info)

This example implementation is used as a part of the Bachelors degree in software development at The University College of Northern Jutland, Aalborg, Denmark.
